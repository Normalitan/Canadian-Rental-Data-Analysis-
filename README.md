# Rental Price Prediction Project..

This project is to explore regression models and attempt to predict rental prices. 

- Manageed to make necessary data cleaning for the dataset, addressing missing values and odd discrepencies within to setup a OneHotEncoder. 
- Started a LinearRegression, RidgeCV, and LassoCV models, evaluated their performances and tune hyperparameters. 
- The project showcases a learning journey for data exploration to model evaluation, better understanding techniques.

Finishing touches require I find degrees suitable to filter throught the data and most importantly predict on a completly new data set this model hasn't seen.
I will compare to NYC rental prices when I find a proper CSV.
